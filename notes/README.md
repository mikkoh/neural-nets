### How many Neurons should a Hidden Layer have?

_In most situations, there is no way to determine the best number of hidden units without training several networks and estimating the generalization error of each. If you have too few hidden units, you will get high training error and high generalization error due to underfitting and high statistical bias. If you have too many hidden units, you may get low training error but still have high generalization error due to overfitting and high variance. Geman, Bienenstock, and Doursat (1992) discuss how the number of hidden units affects the bias/variance trade-off._
